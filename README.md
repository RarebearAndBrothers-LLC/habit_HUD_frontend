Reach Goal #1 
- Team assignment && simulated user 

When a user logs in for the first time he has a choice of joining a group of 5 autonomous individuals. These will be his team while on a 30 day habit rehabiliation. 

The User will only see the progress of his teamates via a simple node-point graph assessing score; score being the cumulative % of succesful days. 

The User can choose to send a message to these other Users via clicking their node on the graph.

One of the Users however will be a simulated person, meaning to replicate pseudo-human behaviour - exhibiting occational pitfalls and bad streaks - but will inevitbly make it to the end. 

User can choose not to accept messages, but may change their minds. 

Reach Goal #2 
- Motivational Video

Optional: Motivational video, neatly hidden away.
